Algorithms are implemented on different machines, with different resources, different processors, different memory, etc. All of these things can affect how an algorithm works. 

Most often these are considerations for how good an algorithm is:

- Efficiency - amount of resources used by an algorithm 
- Space - number of variables, data storage
- Time - number of instructions
