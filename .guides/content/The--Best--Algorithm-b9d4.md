# Many solutions

In a classroom full of students when you give a program assignment you can have as many solutions as you do students. The way that we each process and think about a solution can determine how we go about solving it. 

Have you ever had a test where it has asked you to give the "best answer"? That normally implies there can be more than one right answer but there is one best one. The same concept can apply to algorithms.
