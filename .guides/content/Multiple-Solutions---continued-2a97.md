When you were giving your reasons for the best way to tie your shoe did you have the same answer as your partner?  If not were you able to convince them of your way?  What types of reasons did you give?
- Was your way faster?
- Did it take less steps to get it tied?
 - Is your way just a "simpler" way (according to you?)
 
 These are all questions we ask when evaluating an algorithm.
