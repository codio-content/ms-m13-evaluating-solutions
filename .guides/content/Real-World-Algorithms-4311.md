# Why is efficiency, space, and time important?

Think about all of the real world algorithms you use or others use for work and life every day. 
- Google Maps algorithms for best routes
- Games like Chess programs
- International Space Station programs

These are just 3 wide ranging examples. When we look at an algorithm what may be simple in our example (printing 1 - 100) could be something much larger that costs time, money, and even a person's life ( something medical, etc).
