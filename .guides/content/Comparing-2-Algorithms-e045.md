Lets imagine two different students are asked to write an algorithm (and program it) to print out the numbers from 1 to 100. 

## Student 1 solution
This student uses the print statement and writes 100 lines of code to print out the numbers. 
```
print (1)
print (2)
......
print (100)
```
## Student 2 solution
This student uses a for loop to print out the numbers. 
```
for i in range(100):
    print(i)
```

## Which is better?
With your partner again discuss the two methods above and decide which is better based on the 3 main considerations.
- Efficiency 
- Space
- Time
